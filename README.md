# IITM-Frontend-Project

As an internship test, I was instructed by "TEAM KAATRU" of IIT MADRAS to build a clone static webpage with the help of sample photo which i've also uploaded in this repository(sample.png) for reference.
So in simple words my goal was to build a exact same replica with same font and colors but not to use the same image of building given in the sample.

Fortunately, this project was shortlisted for my 6 months internship in CHENNAI, but because of my college's policy of not allowing students to persue Offline training for more than 2 months, I had to let it go.
